Bitcoin - Turing Incomplete
Turing Complete -  A machine, that given enough time, memory and instructions can solve any computational problem 


Coin - a native/default currency of blockchain  network
token - crated on network using smart contract

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that attempt to peg their value to the market value of another asset or external reference. Many stablecoins peg their value to fiat currencies like the US dollar or tangible assets like gold. This allows many stablecoins to act like a form of digital cash and provide limited volatility. Stable coins are also useful for allowing users on one chain to invest in assets stored off chain or on other chains (e.g. wrapped bitcoin is an ERC-20 token that pegs it's value to Bitcoin but is bought from the Ethereum blockchain). Stable coins do not always have to have a value equal to a single dollar and cannot be gauranteed to stay a consistent price.

A decentralized Oracle network is essential to maintain the security and usefulness of smart contracts. If you were to rely on a single Oracle, specifically a single node providing your smart contract with data, you would open your code up to massive security vulnerabilities. Using a single data source would allow the entity controlling that to essentially control your smart contract and remove the purpose of having it on the blockchain in the first place. Using a decentralized Oracle network is essential to ensure that data is correct, verifiable and cannot be controlled by a single entity. These Oracles networks do not necessarily increase speed or reduce transaction costs.
